## 🎉 Status: COMPLETE

**Total Items:** 120+  
**Completed:** ✅ ALL  
**Remaining:** 0  

### The authentication system is **production-ready** and **working end-to-end**!

All authentication, authorization, and multi-tenancy features are implemented, tested, and documented.

You can now:
1. ✅ Run `./setup-auth.sh` to set up everything
2. ✅ Start the server with `npm run start:dev`
3. ✅ Test with demo credentials or register new users
4. ✅ Build features with automatic auth protection
5. ✅ Use @Roles() for endpoint-specific permissions
6. ✅ Use @CurrentOrganization() for multi-tenant scoping

**Next:** Start building your business features! Authentication is done. 🚀

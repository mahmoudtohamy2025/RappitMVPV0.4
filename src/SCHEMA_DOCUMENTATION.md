# Rappit Database Schema Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the PostgreSQL database schema for Rappit MVP, implementing a multi-tenant SaaS architecture for MENA e-commerce operations.

## Design Principles

1. **Multi-Tenancy**: Every domain entity is scoped to `organization_id` for complete data isolation
2. **Audit Trail**: All entities track `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps
3. **Soft References**: External IDs from integrations stored alongside internal UUIDs
4. **Performance**: Strategic indexes on critical lookup fields (status, tracking numbers, external IDs)
5. **Flexibility**: JSON fields for provider-specific configs and metadata

## Data Retention & Archival

**Recommended Retention Policies**:
- **Orders**: 7 years (compliance)
- **Shipments**: 2 years
- **Inventory Adjustments**: 3 years
- **Webhook Events**: 90 days (archive after 30 days)
- **Integration Logs**: 30 days (archive after 7 days)

**Archival Strategy**: Move old records to separate archive tables or cold storage

---

## Performance Considerations

### Critical Indexes
All critical lookup patterns are indexed:
- Multi-tenant queries: `organization_id` on all tenant-scoped tables
- Status filtering: `status` fields for orders, shipments, webhooks
- External ID lookups: `external_order_id`, `tracking_number`, `external_id`
- Time-based queries: `created_at`, `imported_at`, `reserved_at`

### Query Optimization Tips
1. Always filter by `organization_id` first (partition by tenant)
2. Use composite indexes for common filter combinations
3. Consider partitioning large tables by `created_at` for time-series data
4. Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` for query optimization

### Scaling Considerations
- Use read replicas for reporting queries
- Implement caching (Redis) for frequently accessed data
- Consider table partitioning for orders/logs when exceeding 10M records
- Archive old data regularly

---

## Security & Compliance

### Multi-Tenancy Enforcement
- Row-level security at application level via Prisma middleware
- All queries automatically scoped to `organization_id`
- Foreign key constraints prevent cross-tenant references

### Data Encryption
- Password hashes use bcrypt (cost factor: 10)
- API credentials in `credentials` JSON fields should be encrypted
- Consider PostgreSQL encryption at rest for production

### PII Fields
Fields containing personally identifiable information:
- Users: `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`
- Customers: `email`, `phone`, `first_name`, `last_name`
- Addresses: All fields

**GDPR Compliance**: Implement data export and deletion workflows for customer data

---

## Migration Strategy

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npm run prisma:generate

# Run migration
npm run prisma:migrate deploy

# Seed demo data (optional)
npm run prisma:seed
```

### Schema Changes
1. Update `schema.prisma`
2. Create migration: `npx prisma migrate dev --name description_of_change`
3. Review generated SQL in `prisma/migrations/`
4. Test migration on staging
5. Deploy to production: `npx prisma migrate deploy`

### Rollback Strategy
Keep database backups before migrations. PostgreSQL transactions ensure atomic migrations.

---

## Future Schema Enhancements

**Potential Additions**:
1. **Returns Management**: `Return`, `ReturnItem` tables for RMA workflow
2. **Warehouse Management**: `Warehouse`, `WarehouseLocation` for multi-location inventory
3. **Promotions**: `Discount`, `Coupon` tables for promotional campaigns
4. **Analytics**: Pre-aggregated tables for reporting performance
5. **Multi-Currency**: Enhanced currency support with exchange rates
6. **Product Bundles**: Support for product bundles/kits
7. **Serial Numbers**: Batch/serial number tracking for specific SKUs
8. **Notifications**: `Notification` table for in-app alerts

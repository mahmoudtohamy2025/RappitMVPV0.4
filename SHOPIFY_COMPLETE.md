## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Validate Environment
```bash
./scripts/shopify-admin.sh check-health
```
**Checks:** Environment variables, database connection, API health

### Step 2: Run Tests
```bash
./scripts/shopify-test-suite.sh
```
**Tests:** Health, database, config, webhooks, performance

### Step 3: Create Channel
```bash
# Interactive
./scripts/shopify-admin.sh create-channel

# Or via API
curl -X POST https://your-api.com/api/v1/channels \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Shopify Store",
    "type": "SHOPIFY",
    "organizationId": "ORG_ID",
    "config": {
      "shopDomain": "store.myshopify.com",
      "accessToken": "shpat_xxxxx"
    }
  }'
```

### Step 4: Trigger Sync
```bash
./scripts/shopify-admin.sh sync-all CHANNEL_ID
```
**Syncs:** Products → Orders → Inventory

### Step 5: Monitor
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f scripts/shopify-monitoring.sql
```
**Shows:** Health, performance, errors, stats, alerts

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Data Flow

```
Shopify Store
     ↓
[ShopifyClient]
  - Rate limiting (2 req/s)
  - Retry logic
  - Logging
     ↓
[ShopifyIntegrationService]
  - Product sync
  - Order sync

  - Fulfillment push
     ↓
[Database]
  - Products (with shopify_product_id in metadata)
  - SKUs (with shopify_variant_id in metadata)
  - Orders (via OrdersService)

```

### Sync Schedule

```
Every 5 minutes:  Order sync (incremental, since lastSyncAt)
Every 30 minutes: Product sync (incremental, since lastSyncAt)

```

### Webhook Flow

## 📈 Monitoring Queries

### Quick Health Check

```sql
-- Active channels
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM channels 
WHERE type = 'SHOPIFY' AND is_active = true;

-- Recent syncs
SELECT name, last_sync_at 
FROM channels 
WHERE type = 'SHOPIFY' 
ORDER BY last_sync_at DESC;

-- API errors (last hour)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM integration_logs 
WHERE integration_type = 'SHOPIFY' 
AND status_code >= 400 
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

### Daily Statistics

```sql
-- Products synced
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products 
WHERE channel_id IN (SELECT id FROM channels WHERE type = 'SHOPIFY');

-- Orders synced today
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders 
WHERE channel_id IN (SELECT id FROM channels WHERE type = 'SHOPIFY')
AND DATE(created_at) = CURRENT_DATE;

-- Active reservations
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM inventory_reservations ir
INNER JOIN orders o ON ir.reference_id::text = o.id::text
WHERE o.channel_id IN (SELECT id FROM channels WHERE type = 'SHOPIFY')
AND ir.released_at IS NULL;
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Products not syncing

**Check:**
```bash
# Verify channel config
./scripts/shopify-admin.sh list-channels

# Check integration logs
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT * FROM integration_logs WHERE integration_type='SHOPIFY' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;"

# Trigger manual sync
./scripts/shopify-admin.sh sync-products CHANNEL_ID
```

### Issue: Authentication errors (401, 403)

**Solution:**
1. Verify access token in channel config
2. Check API scopes in Shopify Partner Dashboard
3. Regenerate access token if expired
4. Update channel config with new token

### Issue: Rate limit errors (429)

**Check:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM integration_logs 
WHERE integration_type='SHOPIFY' 
AND status_code=429 
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

**Solution:**
- Verify SHOPIFY_RATE_LIMIT_PER_SECOND=2
- Ensure only one application instance running
- Check for concurrent manual syncs

### Issue: Webhooks not being received

**Check:**
1. Verify webhook URLs in Shopify Partner Dashboard
2. Test HTTPS endpoint is accessible
3. Check SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET matches Shopify
4. View webhook delivery logs in Shopify
